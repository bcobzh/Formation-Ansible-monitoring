    #      This is an alert meant to ensure that the entire alerting pipeline is functional.
    #      This alert is always firing, therefore it should always be firing in Alertmanager
    #      and always fire against a receiver. There are integrations with various notification
    #      mechanisms that send a notification when this alert is not firing. For example the
    #      "DeadMansSnitch" integration in PagerDuty.
